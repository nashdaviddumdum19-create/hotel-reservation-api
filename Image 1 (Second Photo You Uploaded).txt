IT SIA31 – API Development Project

Objective
To design, develop, and present a simple but unique API that demonstrates understanding of API concepts, system integration, and collaboration using GitHub.

Project Requirements

1. API Feature

Your API must have at least 1 functional feature.

The feature must be unique compared to other groups’ work (no duplicates allowed).

Example features: Random recipe generator, School events announcement API, Student study tips API, Daily motivational quotes API, Weather summary for a specific city.

2. Technology

You may use any programming language or framework suitable for API development (e.g., Laravel, FastAPI, Express.js, Flask, Spring Boot).

API should return data in JSON format.

3. GitHub Collaboration

Each group must create a GitHub repository for their API.

Members should: Push code regularly, Pull changes from the repository, Create and merge branches.

Proper commit messages are required (e.g., “Added route for GET /events”).

4. Documentation

Include a README.md in the repository explaining:
• API description and feature
• Installation/setup instructions
• Example request and response

5. Presentation

5–8 minutes per group.

Demonstrate the API running and explain its unique feature.

Show GitHub repository activity as proof of collaboration.
